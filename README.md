### Hi there 

<!--
My name is Pablo Linares, I am currently a PhD student at the Andreou Lab (https://andreoulab.net/) at Johns Hopkins University (https://www.jhu.edu/). My main research interests are in the area of Analog and mixed-signal desing for VLSI. I also work on HDL for ASICs and FPGAs, signal processing and other related fields.

My repositories are a mix of different class projects that I did for my undergrad and masters degree during my time at the Technical School of Engineering (https://etsi.us.es/) at the University of Seville (https://www.us.es/) and projects or parts of projects done while pursuing my PhD at Hopkins.

Some of the things I like doing other than my research are skiing, reading, hiking, and cooking.

You can reach me at plinare1@jhu.edu
